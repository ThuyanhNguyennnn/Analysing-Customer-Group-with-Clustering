# Analysing-Customer-Group-with-Clustering

---

## Project goal
Customer segmentation is dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. It can be employed by all types of businesses, regardless of size, industry and whether they sell online or in person. For example, a small business selling guitars might decide to promote lower-priced products to younger guitarists and higher-priced premium guitars to older musicians based on segment knowledge which tells them that younger musicians have less disposable income than their older counterparts.  


## Task
This project aims to dive into customer consumption behaviour and understand different customer groups to improve the large supermarket chain marketing strategies. Instead of focusing on one major campaign, the strategies will be customized based on different groups of customers.

The data record of this supermarket contains the demographic of 2000 customers collected through loyalty cards. The card tracks when customers use it at checkout, and includes variables such as customer age, gender, annual income, etc. 

### Table of contents:

1. **Introduction** 
    - Motivate the problem and what you are trying to accomplish in this report
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
    - Perform basic exploratory data analysis, present and comment on summary statistics, etc.
3. **Customer Segmentation**
    - Apply the clustering analysis we covered in lectures
    - Choose an optimal number of customer segments/clusters using methods discussed in lectures
    - Interpret identified clusters in terms of customer profiles, e.g. there may be a cluster of university-educated females living in a mid-sized city
    - Use two different clustering techniques
    - How do the clusters identified by the two techniques compare?
4. **Recommendations** 
    - Suggestions regarding marketing techniques based on different clusters of customers 
5. **Conclusion**
