# Analysing-Customer-Group-with-Clustering

---

## Project goal
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. It can be employed by all types of business, regardless of size, industry and whether they sell online or in person. For example, a small business selling guitars might decide to promote lower-priced products to younger guitarists and higher-priced premium guitars to older musicians based on segment knowledge which tells them that younger musicians have less disposable income than their older counterparts.

## Task
The goal of this project is to dive into customer consumption behavior and understand different customer group in order to improve the large super market chain marketing strategies. Instead of focusing on one major campaign, the strategies will be customized based on different group of customer.

The data record of this super market contains the demographic of 2000 customers that has been collected through loyalty cards. The cards tracks when customers use it at checkout, and includes variables such as customer age, gender, annual income, etc.
